# Garden Buddy

This is code imported from my work at Georgia Tech's Enterprise Github server. The GardenBuddy was a mechatronics class project involving the MSP432 microprocessor. GardenBuddy was supposed to function as a human-following robot. It would identify a human's location via GPS coordinates passed to it from a smartphone and navigate to those coordinates.

This class project used concepts from my class including PWM motor control, Proportional control, serial communication, flash memory storage, interrupts, and more.
